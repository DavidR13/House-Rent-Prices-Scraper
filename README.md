# House-Rent-Prices-Scraper

### Built using Python, Selenium, BeautifulSoup, Requests, and Time

## Description
This project uses BeautifulSoup and Selenium to create a bot that will use
a Zillow URL with all the filters already set to store them in lists and
automatically fill out a Google form sheet to put in all the houses for rent.

Specifically, this project was useful to help me mix these two web scraping tools
to develop something useful, as putting these houses for rent in a spreadsheet
allows for easier access.
